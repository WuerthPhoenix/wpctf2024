A new company policy was recently introduced: it is now possible to bring dogs in the office, subject to authorisation!
However, you're more of a cat person and find it unacceptable that your feline friends can't enter!
It turns out, the authorisation method is built upon a small image recognition model, and the code using it was recently leaked by an anonymous employee with the same passion for cats.
Are you able to fool the method and successfully bring your friend to work?
