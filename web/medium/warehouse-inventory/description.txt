# Warehouse Inventory

An outdated web interface for the company's Inventory Management System,
used daily to update warehouse stock, has been discovered.
The system appears to be patched hastily over the years, leaving potential vulnerabilities.
Additionally, a partial source code extraction has revealed key components of its inner workings,
which might be exploitable.
