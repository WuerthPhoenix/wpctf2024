# Medium Misc

## Instructions

Build the container:  
```sh
sh build.sh
```  

Run the challenge:  
```sh
sh run.sh
```  

If you need to exec inside the container for debugging purposes:  
```sh
docker exec -it misc-medium-misconfig /bin/sh    
```  

At this point you can reach the webservice at *http://localhost:5023*.
