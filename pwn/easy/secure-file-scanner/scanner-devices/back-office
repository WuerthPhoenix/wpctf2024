Subject: Parking Situation Update

Dear Team,

We need to address a serious matter: our parking lot has turned into a wild west of car placements.

Double Parking: We love your enthusiasm, but please don’t create a new dance by taking up two spots!

Curb Hopping: Parking partially on the sidewalk is not a trend we want to start. It’s a trip hazard for our fellow employees!

Lost in Space: If your car seems to have parked in an alternate dimension, please bring it back to our reality.

Let’s aim for orderly parking to avoid any future “adventures” involving cones and traffic cops!

Thanks for your cooperation!

Best,
The Back-Office Team

P.S. If you find a car on the roof, just don’t ask. We’re still investigating that one!
