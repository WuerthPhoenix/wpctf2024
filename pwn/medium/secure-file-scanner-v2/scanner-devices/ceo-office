Subject: A Friendly Request to Stop Borrowing Our Ideas

Dear Jordan Blackwood,

I hope this message finds you well! I’ve recently noticed some striking similarities between your products and ours, and I must say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery—though, in this case, it’s getting a little too sincere.

While we appreciate your admiration for our innovative spirit, we’d prefer if you could channel that creativity into something uniquely your own. After all, there’s only room for one of us to set the trends, and we’re quite comfortable in the lead.

We’re confident that with your talents, you can create something just as remarkable—without having to borrow from our playbook.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Best regards,
Alexandra Storm
CEO, NovaTech Industries
