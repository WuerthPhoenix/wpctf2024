Subject: Parking Situation Update

Dear Team,

Thank you for your speedy responses! However, it seems our parking lot has turned into a bit of a free-for-all, so it’s time to rein in the creative chaos. Here's a more structured approach to keeping our lot from becoming a vehicle circus:

The Double Parking Tango:
While it’s tempting to “dance” across two spaces, it’s not the performance we’re looking for. One spot per car, folks—let’s save the duets for the dance floor, not the parking lot. If you’ve got two cars, go ahead and park them separately!

Curbside Acrobatics:
We know parking on the sidewalk feels like a daring stunt, but it’s actually more “clumsy giraffe” than “smooth getaway.” Sidewalks are for pedestrians, not parking lots on parade. Let’s keep the sidewalk clear so no one ends up as an unintentional human obstacle course.

Interdimensional Parking:
If your car has mysteriously drifted into another dimension (aka the furthest corner of the lot, beyond the visible spectrum), it’s time to reel it back into our reality. Parking doesn’t require space travel—just a simple maneuver back to the designated zone will do!

Let’s keep it simple: One spot, no sidewalk gymnastics, and no cars trying to break the laws of physics.

Thanks for your cooperation!

Best,
The Back-Office Team

P.S. If you spot a car on the roof, just keep walking. It’s part of a "top-secret project" we can’t talk about. Yet.
