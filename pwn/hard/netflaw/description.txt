This netsec nerd decided to roll his own NetFlow collector in C. Classic. He dismissed Rust as 'hippie language' and called other collectors 'crap.' Guess he thinks he's hot shit. Well, maybe he is, but that arrogance could be our in. Time to see if his 'performance-optimized' collector has any glaring security holes. A little buffer overflow, perhaps? Or maybe a privilege escalation exploit? The possibilities are endless.
