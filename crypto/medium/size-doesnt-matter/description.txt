Our infiltrator has discovered an endpoint that allows to execute commands on a remote machine. To execute commands, the endpoint requires an execution token, which can be obtained by a separate validation endpoint. Unfortunately, our agent was unable to figure out how to generate a valid token, so they couldn't extract the data. Your mission is to pick up where they left off. Analyze the endpoints, figure out how to craft a valid execution token, and use it to retrieve the data from the remote machine.
